Documentation:
- Explain the flow of the data and code
- Explain the main componenets of the Live2D model
- Explain the AudioPlayer is separated from the Live2D model. 
  The model is rendered by OpenGL and the audio is played by System.Media.SoundPlayer. SoundPlayer is not attached to the model.
- Explain the mouth movement is delayed the first time the audio is played.
  This is because the audio is loaded and played in a different thread. The mouth movement is updated in the main thread.
  However, the mouth movement is synced with the audio after the first time the audio is played.
- How to run the project
- Tools used
  + OpenGL for rendering the model
  + Avalonia as frontend framework
- Document the componenets of the app
- Remove path in code, core dll, todo
- Recommend extensions for Visual Studio Code
  + Avalonia
- Explain where the audio is
- Some models may not open the mouth wide enough, configure the weight in LAppModel.cs: 423
- For more features (tapping the model, saving), check out the Live2DDotNet project (but the project is complicated)

Optional:
- Try to make WPF and OpenTK works

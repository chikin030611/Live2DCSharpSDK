Documentation:

- Explain the main componenets of the Live2D model

- Explain the flow of the data and code

- Tools used
  + OpenGL for rendering the model
  + Avalonia as frontend framework

- Explain where the audio and models is


- Some models may not open the mouth wide enough, configure the weight in LAppModel.cs: 423

- Explain the AudioPlayer is separated from the Live2D model. 
  The model is rendered by OpenGL and the audio is played by System.Media.SoundPlayer. SoundPlayer is not attached to the model.

- Explain the mouth movement is delayed the first time the audio is played.
  This is because the audio is loaded and played in a different thread. The mouth movement is updated in the main thread.
  However, the mouth movement is synced with the audio after the first time the audio is played.
  

- Recommend extensions for Visual Studio Code
  + Avalonia

- For more features (tapping the model, saving), check out the Live2DDotNet project (but the project is complicated)

- Remove path in code, core dll, todo


Optional:
- Try to make WPF and OpenTK works
